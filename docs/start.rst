What is G2P?
************************************

The initial version of this package was developed by [Patrick Littell](https://github.com/littell) and was developed in order to allow for g2p from community orthographies to IPA and back again in [ReadAlong-Studio](https://github.com/dhdaines/ReadAlong-Studio). We decided to then pull out the g2p mechanism from [Convertextract](https://github.com/roedoejet/convertextract) which allows transducer relations to be declared in CSV files, and turn it into its own library - here it is!
