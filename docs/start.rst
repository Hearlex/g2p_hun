What is G2P?
************************************

The initial version of this package was developed by `Patrick Littell <https://github.com/littell>`__ and was developed in order to allow for g2p from community orthographies to IPA and back again in `ReadAlong-Studio <https://github.com/dhdaines/ReadAlong-Studio>`__. We decided to then pull out the g2p mechanism from `Convertextract <https://github.com/roedoejet/convertextract>`__ which allows transducer relations to be declared in CSV files, and turn it into its own library - here it is!
