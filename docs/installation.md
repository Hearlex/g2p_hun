# Installation

You can either install `g2p` with pip from PyPi:

```bash
pip install g2p
```

Or by cloning and installing from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roedoejet/g2p.git

cd g2p

pip install -e .
```

To install in an isolated environment (recommended for development)
you may use [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/):

```
hatch shell
```
