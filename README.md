> Grapheme-to-Phoneme transductions that preserve input and output indices!

This library is for handling arbitrary transductions between input and output segments while preserving indices.

## Background

The initial version of this package was developed by [Patrick Littell](https://github.com/littell) and was developed in order to allow for G2P from community orthographies to IPA and back again in [ReadAlong-Studio](https://github.com/dhdaines/ReadAlong-Studio). We decided to then pull out the G2P mechanism from [Convertextract](https://github.com/roedoejet/convertextract) which allows transducer relations to be declared in CSV files, and turn it into its own library - here it is!

## Install

The best thing to do is clone the repo and pip install it locally.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/roedoejet/g2p.git
$ cd g2p
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

In order to initialize a `Transducer`, you must first create a `Correspondence` object.

### Correspondence

You can create correspondences either by initializing them directly with a list:

```python
from g2p.cors import Correspondence

cors = Correspondence([{"from": 'a', "to": 'b'}])

```

Alternatively, you can add a CSV file to g2p/cors/langs/<YourLang>/<YourLookupTable>

```python
from g2p.cors import Correspondence

cors = Correspondence(language={"lang": "<YourLang>", "table": "<YourLookupTable>"})

```

### Transducer

Initialize a `Transducer` with a `Correspondence` object. Calling the `Transducer` then produces the output. In order to preserve the indices, pass index=True when calling the `Transducer`.

```python
from g2p.cors import Correspondence
from g2p.transducer import Transducer

cors = Correspondence([{"from": 'a', "to": 'b'}])
transducer = Transducer(cors)
transducer('a')
# 'b'
transducer('a', index=True)
# ('b', <g2p.transducer.IOStates object>)

```

To make sense of the `IOStates` object that is produced, you can either call it, and produce a list of each character. Doing that for the above produces `[((0, 'a'), (0, 'b'))]` - a list of relation tuples where each relation tuple is comprised of an input and output. Each input and output is in turn comprised of an index and a corresponding character. You can also call `up()` and `down()` to see the output and input respectively.
